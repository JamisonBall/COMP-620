Description: A parallel program to find the target value from a list of ints. Each process (when this was written it was tested on a 2 processor
System) searches a portion of the array and prints whether or not it was able to find the target value.

Notes:
As I said I tested this on a 2 processor virtual machine that's why some values are hard-coded.
This was written on a Linux VM, so be aware of any portability issues
There is a serial part of my code involving initalization of the target value and the creation of a buffer (which has been tested to be
distinct between processors) which is intended to hold each process's respective "chunk" of the search dataset. This serial portion also
declares ints which are passed to MPI_Init() upon creation of the parallel environment. After this initial setup, MPI_Init is called and
process 0 (the one which did the initialization steps) does an MPI_Scatter communication to the other processes to distribute the array chucks
for searching. A parallel linear search is performed and if the value is found the process prints:
"Process X was able to find [the target]" followed by a newline character otherwise the process will print:
"Process X was unable to find [the target]. (Assume X is the processor rank.)

I have made every effort to ensure this is a "parallel program", by doing a rank check as follows:

if(rank == 0) {
    //search
} else if(rank != 0) {
    //search
}
